# Autoinspira

It is my first hybrid app, and it is builded using Framewrok7, and compiled with phonegap.

App created to represent market value for used and new cars in Mexico, it contains info about all types on cars in three options.

The first options are prices recommended for dealers and sales cars agencies, the last option is desgined to check recommended prices to sell the user auto.
- By price range.
- By Brand.
- By Brand.




Contains car characteristics as Price, description, horse power,fuel consumption. etc...

Will be updating it as I build some new features.
